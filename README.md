# Daily Dutch Vocabulary Email Automation

## Overview
This project automates the daily delivery of an email containing three C1-level Dutch words, their English translations, and example sentences. The email looks like this:

## Motivation
I created this project because I couldn't find a suitable app to help me build a C1-level Dutch vocabulary. I discovered that ChatGPT provides good word suggestions and decided to automate the process. Additionally, I know that I check emails more consistently than apps, making this method more effective for learning.

This project also provided an opportunity to refresh my skills in **Terraform** and **Python**.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
To deploy this project, ensure the following tools and configurations are in place:

1. **Tools Installed:**
   - Python (Tested with Python 3.8)
   - pip (Tested with pip 19.2.3)
   - Terraform (Tested with Terraform 1.10.3)
   - AWS CLI (Tested with 2.15.58)

2. **Permissions:**
   Your AWS CLI user must have the appropriate permissions to deploy the resources. Refer to the Terraform files and apply the principle of least privilege.

3. **Amazon SES Verified Email:**
   You need a verified email address in Amazon SES. This email must match the one used in the project.  
   Reference: [Verifying Email Addresses in Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html#verify-email-addresses-procedure).

4. **Optional:**  
   You can zip the Lambda deployment package manually if you like:
   - Use the provided `setup.sh` script or follow the steps in the script manually (might need small modifications if on Mac/Linux)  
   - Alternatively, use the pre-zipped package: `deployment_package.zip`.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Configuration:**
   - Copy `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
   - Fill out the required values in `terraform.tfvars`.

2. **Run the Terraform Workflow:**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Considerations

This project was intended as a **weekend project**, so there is room for improvement. Potential enhancements include:
- Refactoring the Python code to be asynchronous for better performance and robustness.
- Splitting the `lambda_function.py` file into smaller modules for better organization and maintainability.

However, since the project fulfills its purpose and is unlikely to grow further, I kept the implementation simple.
